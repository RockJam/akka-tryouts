Yet another project for fun(and killing time)
============
Attempt to make a platform that allows you to write turn-based games for two+ players(people or bots) conviniently, using websockets as transport protocol.
Currently two games are implemented:
* Tic-Tac-Toe
* Virus war(https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Война_вирусов)

TODO:
* Complete rules for Win/Lose in virus war
* Make simple AI for Virus war game
* Make virus war gameboard look nicer(at least make x and o fit in center of cell)
* Show currently running games(like localhost:9004/view, but not only for tic tac toe)
* Split frontend and backend & make frontend easier to develop
